*(La Selva)* Things have really gotten into a rhythm now, which is nice when doing fieldwork because it gives you a little bit more of a sense that you know what to expect. Today we collected more for our project, which entails walking around in the woods seeing lots of stuff.

I continue to see a huge number of things I have never seen before, including something that was very high up on my list- an Eyelash Viper (*Bothriechis schlegelii*, above). These small snakes can be banana yellow or mottled green, and though I’ve been expecting to see the green morph, it is so stunning to see a uniformly bright yellow snake against a leafy background at night. A real highlight of the trip!

You may have seen the segment of BBC’s Planet Earth which captured the black with iridescent blue Superb Bird of Paradise (*Lophorina superba*) male displaying for a female. The male makes a loud clacking noise with his wings while hopping side to side with his plumage held out. Well, there are no birds of paradise here, but today at lunch I heard a sound very similar to that coming from the bushes not 10 feet from my seat. It was a small, sparrow sized bird called a [White Collared Manakin](https://www.google.com/search?q=white+collared+manakin&hl=en&rlz=1C1CHFA_enUS484US484&prmd=imvns&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=hcnUT7baGaPa2AXT06WOCw&ved=0CGEQsAQ&biw=1036&bih=706) jumping among a bunch of vertical stems, clacking his wings. This was an immature male getting the hang of the dance, but I’d say he does a pretty good job. VERY cool!
