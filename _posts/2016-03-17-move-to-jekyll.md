After a bit of fiddling, I've worked up a new personal website. I will keep [my old site](http://jimmyodonnell.wordpress.com) up and running, but will migrate all of the content from there over to here.

The primary motivation for this move is that [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a much more intuitive system for managing a personal website+blog. I have always written my blog posts as plain text files, pasting them into the wordpress ('.com') page upon completion. I never learned wordpress ('.org') because it seemed unnecessary and excessive for my needs, and it seems much of the web development community agrees.
