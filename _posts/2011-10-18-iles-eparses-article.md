I was recently working with some of the data from our trip to the French Îles Éparses (“Scattered Islands”) in the Western Indian Ocean, and remembered that I hadn’t posted a link to the popular press article that was written about the trip.  The piece was written up by a journalist that traveled with us on the ship, the Marion Dufresne.  It’s in French, but Google Translate will solve that problem for the french-illiterate (myself included).  You can find the first part of the five-part online version of the article, published by the French magazine Sciences et Avenir, [here](http://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/nature-environnement/20110704.OBS6396/expedition-aux-iles-eparses-premiere-escale-a-grande-glorieuse.html).

The blog that Giacomo and I kept while traveling can be found [here](http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/bernardi/Clownfish/Clownfish/Blog/Blog.html).
