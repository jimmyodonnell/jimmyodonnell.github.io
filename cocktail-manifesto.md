# Booze Roolez

I like to make cocktails at home. I think one of my first decent home cocktails was at a friend's house back in Florida, where he made us Old Fashioneds--a great memory. Back in Santa Cruz, when we lived in Bonny Doon, we (1) didn't have the money to be going out for decent cocktails and (2) lived outside of town, so couldn't just walk home or get a ride easily. It was here that I first started regularly making cocktails, including my first Mai Tai. My home cocktail enthusiasm boomed again when we had our first kid (making it harder to escape for a night out) and again in 2020. I love the variety and creativity, and the fact that it is much cheaper per serving.

I view a cocktail as a solution of chemicals including ethanol, water, and "trace amounts" of other stuff. That other stuff might be:
- Compounds extracted into alcohol from plants, such as:
    - oak wood extracted into alcohol during aging
    - wormwood extracted into alcohol for absinthe
- Acids
- Sugars
- Compounds directly imparted from the ingredients, such as the juice of citrus or pomegranate

## Easy ways to improve your cocktails
1. Use more ice
2. Mix more
3. Use better ice
4. Use a better glass

## Booze recommendations
These are staples in my home bar.
- Tequila
- Mezcal
- Gin: Citadelle
- Bourbon-ish: Buffalo Trace
- Rye: Rittenhouse or Dickel
- Rum:
    - General purpose: Plantation Grand Reserve 5 year
    - Jamaican aged: Smith and Cross (~$35, my favorite rum); Doctor Bird (~$25)
    - Jamaican unaged: Wray and Nephew
    - Raw Cane Martinique (Agricole): Aged: Neisson Eleve Sous Bois. Unaged: Still searching!
    - Raw Cane Brazil (Cacha√ßa): Aged: Pitu Gold (unbelievable value). Unaged: Pitu Silver
    - Sipping: Barbancourt 15year or Neisson Eleve Sous Bois
    - Rum is my favorite booze.
- Liqueurs:
    - Herbal 1: Genepy Des Alpes, Liquore Strega, Green Chartreuse.
    - Herbal 2: Benedictine
    - Herbal 3: I love Absinthe and Pastis, but have no strong brand preference on either. Some absinthes I have really enjoyed are Vieux Pontarlier, Leopold Bros, and Pacifique.
    - Herbal 4: Campari. I don't find Aperol to be worth keeping around, because side by side it tastes like a weak Campari. In cocktails that call for Aperol, I substitute half (or less) the amount of Campari.
    - Floral: St Germain
    - Fruity: Cherry: Luxardo or Maraska Maraschino. Orange: I make my own "triple sec" style orange liqueur. Cointreau and Grand Marnier are just booze flavored after distillation. You can do that at home.

## Don't futz around with silly one-off syrups
### Orgeat
Orgeat is a distinctive almond and orange blossom syrup that is absolutely critical to several cocktails, including the Mai Tai. I've made orgeat a bunch of different ways, and compared them side by side to commercial products. I have found the best method is to _not make orgeat_, for two reasons. First, unless you are using **bitter** almonds, the almonds contribute almost no flavor, and especially none of the aromatic, marzipan-type flavor that is so critical. Second, it goes bad before you can use it, and that's coming from a Mai Tai enthusiast. If I were trying to impress someone, and making drinks for a party where I was sure I'd use the batch, I would make orgeat by combining almond milk, sugar, almond extract, and orange blossom water. Almond milk does add a nice texture/mouthfeel and cloudiness to the cocktail, but almost no flavor. However, for standard home use, I combine equal parts almond extract and orange blossom water in a dropper bottle. To replace the 1/4 ounce orgeat in a Mai Tai, I add maybe 10 drops of this mix, and up the simple syrup a bit.
