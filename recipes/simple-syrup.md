| ---------- | ------ |
| 350 g | sugar |
| 175 g | water |

- Start boiling water in kettle.
- Weigh sugar into 2-cup microwavable measuring cup.
- Pour 175 g boiling water into cup and stir.
- Microwave for 30-60 seconds at a time, stopping to stir until sugar is dissolved.



#### Notes
- Most of the time, the "standard", expected/specified simple syrup is 1:1 ratio sugar:water by volume. However, in this lower concentration, the syrup can start to grow microorganisms before I actually use it. High concentrations of sugar inhibit microbial growth, so I make concentrated syrup.
- One cup of sugar weighs about 200g. One cup of water weighs about 230g. By weight, this is a 0.87:1 sugar:water ratio.
- Math for 1:1 by volume:
    - 15 ml sugar (14g) dissolved into 15 ml (15g) water comes to 24ml.
    - final volume is 0.8 of additive volume
    - sugar ratio to final:
        - VOLUME: 15ml of 24ml is 0.625.
        - WEIGHT: 14g of 29g is 0.48
