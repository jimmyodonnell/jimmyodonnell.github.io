### Ingredients

| ---------- | ------ |
| 6 | cloves |
| 5 tsp | cumin seeds |
| 4 | green cardamom pods |
| 3 | black cardamom pods |
| 1 | cinnamon stick |
| 2 tsp | coriander seeds |
| 1-2 tsp | black peppercorns (to taste, if you like it spicy, add more) |
| 1/2 tsp | grated nutmeg (to taste) |


### Steps
- Add all the spices (except nutmeg) to a cast iron skillet and dry roast the spices on med-hi heat for ~5 minutes or until the spices darken and start to smell yummy. Stir often so they don't burn. 
- Add spices to a bowl, add nutmeg and let cool
- Grind spices into a fine powder either with mortar and pestle or spice grinder (avoid a coffee grinder since your spices will taste like coffee and vice versa). 
- P.S. Forgot to add (don't grind the cardamom pods, just the seeds

Notes: Good for at least 2 months or less in an air tight jar. Great for seasoning chicken for BBQs or for basic chicken stew/curry recipes.
