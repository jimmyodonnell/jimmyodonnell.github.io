#### Notes
* Whiskey: Morgenthaler recommends "cask-proof bourbon", especially Booker's. Booker's, as far as I can tell, is expensive, when you can find it. His alternative recommendations are [Old Grand Dad 114](https://thewhiskeyjug.com/bourbon-whiskey/old-grand-dad-114-review/) (~$30) and [Stagg Jr.](https://thewhiskeyjug.com/bourbon-whiskey/stagg-jr-review/) (~$150?).
* Original recipe calls for a teaspoon (5mL) of 2:1 simple syrup. I find it plenty sweet without this addition.
