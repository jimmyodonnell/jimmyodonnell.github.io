### Dough

| ---------- | ------ |
| 1 cup | milk, scalded and cooled |
| 1 tablespoon | active dry yeast |
| ¼ cup | warm water (no hotter than 110 degrees Fahrenheit) |
| ½ cup | granulated sugar |
| 1 teaspoon | crushed cardamom seeds (the seeds of about 5-8 pods) |
| -- | zest of one large orange or zests of several clementines |
| 1 teaspoon | kosher salt |
| 2 | large eggs |
| 4 ½ to 5 cups (540 to 600g) | all purpose flour, plus more for dusting |
| 1 stick | unsalted butter, melted and cooled |


### Wash/Toppings

- 1 large egg and 1 tablespoon milk
- Sliced almonds
- Sugar, preferably coarse


### Steps
1. Scald the milk then add the sugar, salt, and cardamom. Allow to steep.
2. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and make sure it foams (aka, is alive!).
3. When the scalded milk has cooled to about room temp, beat in the eggs, then add the yeast mixture, butter, and zest, mixing well. 
4. Pour the wet mix into a stand mixer with dough hook or into a large bowl and stir in enough flour to get a shaggy dough.
5. Continue adding flour little by little either using the dough hook on low speed or kneading by hand (or with a flexible pastry scraper) until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl and is less sticky. 
6. Knead by hand or with the mixer for an additional 5-10 minutes until it is elastic and smooth.
7. Allow to rise in a oiled bowl in a warm place for 45 min to an hour (until doubled in size).
8. After about an hour, punch the dough down gently and separate into three balls rolling each into a long log about 30-40 inches long.
9. Braid the three strands and connect the ends, pinching them together to close the circle and create your wreath. Transfer the braided wreath to a parchment lined baking sheet and allow to rise for about 45 minutes. 
10. Preheat your oven to 375. Brush the wreath with the egg and milk wash and sprinkle with nuts and sugar. Slide onto the center rack of your preheated oven and bake until deeply colored, about 20-25 minutes.  It's wonderful warm and is best eaten the same day you bake it.
