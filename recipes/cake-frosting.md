### Chocolate Ganache Frosting

| ---------- | ------ |
| 1 pound (455g) | fine-quality semisweet chocolate such as Callebaut |
| 1 cup (235 ml) | heavy cream |
| 2 tablespoons (25g) | sugar |
| 2 tablespoons (40g) | light corn syrup |
| 1/2 stick (1/4 cup, 55g) | unsalted butter |

Makes enough for two 10- by 2-inch round cake pans


- Finely chop chocolate. In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan bring cream, sugar, and corn syrup to a boil over moderately low heat, whisking until sugar is dissolved. Remove pan from heat and add chocolate, whisking until chocolate is melted.
- Cut butter into pieces and add to frosting, whisking until smooth.
- Transfer frosting to a bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until spreadable (depending on chocolate used, it may be necessary to chill frosting to spreadable consistency).
- Spread frosting between cake layers and over top and sides. Cake keeps, covered and chilled, 3 days. Bring cake to room temperature before serving.

#### Notes
- 2014-10-12: I made the ganache using 6 oz 72% dark chocolate, 1 cup cream, and 1/4 cup sugar to fill and glaze two 8 inch rounds.

### Ermine (Cooked Flour) Frosting

#### Serious Eats Version:
| --- | --- |
| 1 ounce (about 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons; 28g) | all-purpose flour |
| 6 ounces (about 3/4 cup; 170g) | milk, any percentage will do |
| 3 1/4 ounces (96g) | plain or toasted sugar |
| Heaping 1/4 teaspoon (1.5g) | Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more to taste; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight |
| 6 ounces (160g) | unsalted butter, softened to about 65°F (18°C) |
| 1/4 ounce (1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g), plus more to taste | vanilla extract |

- In a 10-inch skillet or 3-quart saucier, whisk together flour and milk.
- Place over medium heat, whisking constantly, and cook until thick and pudding-like, about 2 minutes.
- Off heat, add sugar and salt.
- Whisk until sugar has dissolved and the "pudding" is homogeneous but thin.
- Scrape mixture into a wide, shallow dish, such as a pie plate, and cool to approximately 70°F (21°C).
- Place butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.
- Mix on low until the butter looks smooth, then increase speed to medium and beat until soft and light, about 5 minutes.
- Begin adding the cooled pudding, a few tablespoons at a time.
- Once it's fully incorporated, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then resume beating until perfectly smooth.
- Switch to the whisk attachment and add vanilla. Whip on low to combine, then increase speed to medium-high and continue whipping until silky-smooth and soft, with a light, melt-in-your-mouth consistency, about 3 minutes more, or to a working temperature of approximately 75°F (24°C).
- Season to taste with additional salt and/or vanilla as needed.
- Use immediately, or consult the troubleshooting guide below to address any textural inconsistencies.

- _Troubleshooting_: If the frosting feels dense, stiff, greasy, or curdled, it is likely too cold; to warm, briefly set over a pan of steaming water, just until you see the edges melting slightly, then re-whip. If the frosting feels soft and loose, it is likely too warm. Pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes to cool, then re-whip.

#### Wilton Version
[From here](https://www.wilton.com/easy-ermine-frosting-recipe/WLRECIP-8801.html)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

- In a medium saucepan, stir together sugar, flour, salt. Whisk in milk until smooth.
- Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until very thick, about 5-7 minutes.
- Remove from heat, pour into bowl or plate and cover with plastic wrap to cool.
- Once cooled, beat butter at medium speed for 5 minutes or until light and fluffy.
- Add milk mixture a tablespoon at a time, beating until smooth, and scraping down sides often.
- Add vanilla and beat for 3 more minutes, or until it reaches the consistency of whipped cream.

- This recipe makes about enough ermine frosting to cover and decorate a single 6-inch round cake.
