Pretty standard proportions, but this came from [The Merry Gourmet blog](https://www.merrygourmet.com/2012/03/making-changes-a-recipe-chocolate-cake-with-vanilla-buttercream-frosting).



### Chocolate Ganache Frosting

| ---------- | ------ |
| 1 pound (455g) | fine-quality semisweet chocolate such as Callebaut |
| 1 cup (235 ml) | heavy cream |
| 2 tablespoons (25g) | sugar |
| 2 tablespoons (40g) | light corn syrup |
| 1/2 stick (1/4 cup, 55g) | unsalted butter |

Makes enough for two 10- by 2-inch round cake pans


- Finely chop chocolate. In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan bring cream, sugar, and corn syrup to a boil over moderately low heat, whisking until sugar is dissolved. Remove pan from heat and add chocolate, whisking until chocolate is melted.
- Cut butter into pieces and add to frosting, whisking until smooth.
- Transfer frosting to a bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until spreadable (depending on chocolate used, it may be necessary to chill frosting to spreadable consistency).
- Spread frosting between cake layers and over top and sides. Cake keeps, covered and chilled, 3 days. Bring cake to room temperature before serving.

#### Notes
- 2014-10-12: I made the ganache using 6 oz 72% dark chocolate, 1 cup cream, and 1/4 cup sugar to fill and glaze two 8 inch rounds.
