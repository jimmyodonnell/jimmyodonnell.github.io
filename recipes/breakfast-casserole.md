## French Toast Breakfast Casserole

| ---------- | ------ |
| 0.25 - 0.5 cup | brown sugar or maple syrup |
| 0.5 stick | unsalted butter |
| 8 ounces | crusty French bread, cut into bite-sized pieces, or more as needed |
| 2 cups | milk |
| 6 | large eggs |
| 2 teaspoons | vanilla extract |
| 0.5 teaspoon | ground cinnamon |
| 1 cup | frozen blueberries |

1. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
1.  Stir brown sugar and butter together in a saucepan over medium-low heat until butter is melted and sugar has dissolved, 2 to 4 minutes.
1.  Pour butter-brown sugar mixture into the prepared baking dish. Scatter French bread pieces over top in a 1 1/2- to 2-inch layer.
1.  Whisk milk, eggs, and vanilla together in a bowl until well combined. Pour over bread pieces, then press bread down with a spatula so the bread absorbs the liquid. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
1.  The next morning, bake 45-60 min at 350ºF.
