| salt | 0.5 tsp |
| baking powder | 0.5 tsp |
| baking soda | 0.25 tsp |
| yogurt (plain, non-greek) | 1 cup (227 g) |
| butter | 2 TBSP |
| egg | 1 |

- Melt the butter in the microwave.

### Original recipe

| ---------- | ------ |
| 1/2 cup | whole wheat flour |
| 1/2 cup | all purpose flour |
| 2 tsp | sugar |
| 1/2 tsp | salt |
| 1/2 tsp | baking powder |
| 1/4 tsp | baking soda |
| 1 cup | buttermilk |
| 2 TBSP | butter |
| 1 | egg, separated |

- Set out 1 cup buttermilk the night before.

- Start by melting butter so it can start to cool while you work on the other ingredients.

- In a small bowl, mix together the dry ingredients and set aside.

- In a large bowl, whip the egg white until firm peaks form.

- In a small bowl (or coffee mug), stir up the egg yolk, and add the buttermilk and the melted butter.  Be careful with this step, as it's easy to cook the yolk if the butter is too hot.  I messed up by putting the yolk into the butter, but had success mixing the egg and buttermilk, then adding the butter to that cool container.  Might also try cooling the butter and adding it to the egg yolk, then adding the buttermilk?

- Dump the wet ingredients (buttermilk, yolk, butter) and the dry ingredients into the egg white bowl and gently fold together.  Should be mixed, but remain very lumpy.  Some dry spots and some egg white spots are fine.

#### Notes:
- Mom's original recipe calls for 1/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup buttermilk, but buttermilk comes in 1 cup increments, so I tried it with all buttermilk and it works fine.
- Add ins: Vanilla is a good add in.  Regardless of whether I'm using extract or whole beans, I add it to the butter.
