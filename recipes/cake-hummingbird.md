#### Notes:

PRE 2016
Hummingbird Cake

Set out eggs, butter, and cream cheese the night before!

Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt*
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup vegetable oil*
3 eggs
1 (8 oz.) can crushed pineapple with juice
2 cups diced bananas
1 cup chopped pecans (plus extra for sprinkling on top of the icing)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a 12 cup Bundt pan+.

2. Measure flour, sugar, soda, salt, and cinnamon and stir to mix.  Add oil, eggs, and vanilla, and stir well, until dry ingredients are moistened. Stir in pineapple with juice, bananas, and pecans. Pour into prepared pan.

3. Bake in oven for about 70 minutes. (I checked it after 60 minutes) Turn cake out onto rack or plate after cooling for 20 minutes. Cool, and ice with cream cheese icing.

Cream Cheese Icing:
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 tsp vanilla
16 oz powdered sugar
Beat cheese and butter until smooth.  Blend in vanilla.  Gradually beat in sugar.

+ Or use three 9-inch round cake pans and bake for 25-30 minutes.
* Recipe copied from a blog- Southern Living cookbook has same recipe but with a full tsp of salt, a full cup of oil, and uses round cake pans.  Southern Living also uses only 1 tsp of vanilla in the icing.
