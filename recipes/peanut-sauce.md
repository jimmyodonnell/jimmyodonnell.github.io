### Ingredients

| ---------- | ------ |
| 1-inch piece | ginger |
| 1 | garlic clove |
| 1/3 cup | natural creamy peanut butter |
| 2 tablespoons | soy sauce|
| 1 tablespoon | fresh lime juice |
| 1 teaspoon | (packed) light brown sugar |
| 1 teaspoon | Sriracha |
| 1 teaspoon | toasted sesame oil |
| 4 tablespoons | water |
| 3 | summer squash, peeled and spiralized |
| 2 | large carrots, grated |
| ½ | large seedless cucumber, chopped |
| 4 | scallions, chopped |
| ¼ cup | roasted, unsalted peanuts, chopped |

### Steps

- Make the peanut sauce:
    - In a food processor or blender, combine the ginger, garlic, peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, Sriracha, sesame oil, and 3 tablespoons room temperature water.
    - Pulse until smooth, adding 1 more tablespoon of water if needed to give the sauce a pourable, silky consistency. *Do not add more than 4 tablespoons of water or the sauce will be too thin.
- In a large bowl, combine the summer squash, carrots, cucumber, and scallions.
- Pour the peanut sauce on top and toss well to coat all of the squash noodles and veggies.
- Divide the salad among 4 bowls and sprinkle the top of each with 1 tablespoon of chopped peanuts.
