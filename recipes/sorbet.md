The general sorbet process is:
- Purée ingredients in blender until smooth.
- Chill until very cold.
- Churn in ice cream machine for ~15-25 minutes.


### Cherry Sorbet

| ---------- | ------ |
| 500 g (before pitting) | cherries |

Try with bitters and/or a little rye. Great topped with both.

### Plum Sorbet

| ---------- | ------ |
| 2 lbs (about 2.25 lbs before pitting), about 4 cups | plums |
| 1 cup | sugar |
| 1 tbsp | light corn syrup |
| 1/4 tsp | kosher salt |
| to taste | lemon juice |

1. Purée plums in a blender or food processor until smooth. 2 pounds pitted plums should yield 1 quart of purée. Add sugar and corn syrup and blend for 30 seconds. Add salt, blend to incorporate, and adjust to taste. If plums are very sweet, add lemon juice to taste, starting with 1/4 teaspoon.

2. Strain purée and transfer to refrigerator; chill for 2 to 3 hours until very cold. Churn sorbet in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer sorbet to freezer to firm up for 2 to 3 hours before serving.

#### Notes:
- 2013 06 26: Got a ton of plums, pitted them and put them in the blender until it was essentially full. Blended the hell out of them, and the final volume came to about 40 ounces. I sweetened to taste, in this case I used about 1.5 cups sugar for the whole shebang. about 8-10 ounces of this went into the ice cream, the rest I refrigerated, and stirred in a little Sailor Jerry just before putting in the machine (maybe .25-.5 cup, this keeps it from freezing into a solid rock).

Plum Ice cream:
- whisk 2 eggs until they thicken slightly and are a pale yellow. Add .5 cup sugar, whisk until dissolved. Add 2 cups cream, whisk again. Stir in a generous cup of the plum puree used for sorbet, and grate in maybe a teaspoon of nutmeg. Freeze in ice cream machine, and add a half cup of chopped ripe plums at the very end.

### Peach Sorbet

| ---------- | ------ |
| 600 g after pitting | sliced |
| NA | juice of 1 small lemon |
| 75 g | sugar |

#### Notes:
- Ended up too icy, crumbly, and brownish. Back to the drawing board!
