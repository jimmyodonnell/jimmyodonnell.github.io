- 3-4 Tbsp Aleppo pepper soaked in some water
- 2 Tbsp bread crumbs
- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- 1-2 tsp ground cumin
- 2-3 tsp pomegranate syrup or 1Tbsp lemon juice +1/2 tsp sugar
- some salt

put all the ingredients in a food processor and pulse while drizzling up to 1/2 cup of water, until a soft paste forms.

spread in a dish and drizzle with some olive oil. you can add 1/2 tsp or more cayenne pepper if you like it spicier.
good side dish with chips, and sublime with roasted chicken.
hope you and Sally are well, and maybe will see you on our next visit the end of July.
