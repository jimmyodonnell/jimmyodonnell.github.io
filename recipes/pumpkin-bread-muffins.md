#### Notes
* Note: Recipe originally called for "Smart Balance", which makes me think I might have gotten this recipe from Josh at FLMNH. This can be substituted with butter or 3TBSP oil (12.5g/tbsp * 3 = 37.5g).

missing a half cup honey; added a half cup sugar - 100g
Honey is sweeter than sugar, so you can use about 3/4 the amount of honey when making your substitution (e.g., for 1 cup of sugar, use a generous 3/4 cup of honey). Decrease the liquid by 3 to 4 tablespoons per 1 cup substitution. No added liquid in your recipe? Add about 3 to 4 tablespoons of additional flour for every cup of honey used (about 1 tablespoon per 1/4 cup).
