Bon Appetit Ingredients
| ---------- | ------ |
| 1 | medium onion, chopped |
| 1 | celery stalk, chopped |
| 1 | small carrot, peeled, chopped |
| 3 Tbsp | extra-virgin olive oil |
| 1 lb | ground beef chuck (20% fat), patted dry |
| some | Kosher salt |
| 3 oz | thinly sliced pancetta, finely chopped |
| 1 cup | dry white wine |
| ⅓ cup | tomato paste |
| 1 | bay leaf |
| Pinch | finely grated nutmeg |
| 2 cups (or more) | homemade chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth |
| 1 | cup whole milk |
| 1 lb | fresh tagliatelle or pappardelle, or dry rigatoni |
| 2 oz | finely grated Parmesan (about ½ cup), plus more for serving |


NYT Ingredients
| ---------- | ------ |
| 1 tablespoon | vegetable oil |
| 3 tablespoons | butter (plus 1 tablespoon for tossing the pasta) |
| ½ cup | chopped onion |
| ⅔ cup | chopped celery |
| ⅔ cup  | chopped carrot |
| ¾ pound | ground beef chuck (or you can use 1 part pork to 2 parts beef) |
| to taste | Salt |
| to taste | Black pepper, ground fresh from the mill |
| 1 cup  | whole milk |
| to taste | Whole nutmeg |
| 1 cup  | dry white wine |
| 1 ½ cups | canned imported Italian plum tomatoes, cut up, with their juice |
| 1 ¼ to 1 ½ pounds | pasta |
| to taste | Freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese at the table |


- Chop onion fine (I use julienne mandoline)
- chop celery small
- grate carrot on box grater
- dice (? cut up into small pieces) the bacon
- cook bacon in pot (I use dutch oven but not raw cast iron) until cooked and a little browned and crispy but not necessarily crunchy all the way through
- once it's there, add all the veggies
- meanwhile, in a big skillet, break up the beef and cook until lightly browned in another skillet (I use a big cast iron)
- when the beef is cooked, I haven't had a lot of stuff stuck to the pan, and also not a ton of grease. I just use a slotted spatula of whatever and put it in with the veggies
- cook veggies on lowish until the veggies get cooked and things start sticking to the bottom of the pot
- once the veggies are sticking to the pan, deglaze with some wine. I like to stir it in in batches. if you're using fish sauce for salt, I like to add it now.
- once the beef is cooked add it to veggies
- once once all the wine has been added and stirred in and pretty much completely cooked off, add tomato paste and cook and stir until darkened.
- then add liquid (stock and milk or tomatoes), the nutmeg and bay, and stir in, bring to a boil on high
- then put on extremely low, such that a bubble only pops up every once in a while. I think maybe its best to do this with a lid partially cracked open.
- cook for ~2-3 hrs

#### Notes:
4 servings


#### Bon Appetit steps
1. Pulse onion, celery, and carrot in a food processor until very finely chopped. Transfer to a small bowl.
2. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or other large pot over medium. Break beef into small clumps (about 1½") and add to pot; season lightly with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally but not breaking meat apart, until beef is lightly browned but not crisp, 6–8 minutes. It may be gray in spots (that’s okay!) and still a little pink in the center. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a medium bowl.
3. Wipe out pot. Cook pancetta in pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until pancetta has released some of its fat and is crisp, 6–8 minutes. Add onion mixture to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very soft and beginning to stick to surface, 6–8 minutes.
4. Return beef to pot and pour in wine. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, smashing down on beef with a wooden spoon, until wine is evaporated, surface of pot is almost dry, and meat is finely ground, 12–15 minutes. (The meat should be reduced to what looks like little bits. It takes a bit of effort, but you can take breaks.) Add tomato paste, bay leaf, and nutmeg and cook, stirring occasionally and still pressing down on meat, until tomato paste is slightly darkened, about 5 minutes.
5. Pour stock and milk into pot; add a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to the lowest setting and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until meat is very, very tender, 2–2½ hours. There shouldn’t be any rapid bubbles at this stage. Instead, the sauce should release the occasional small bubble or two. When finished, the sauce should have the texture of and look like a sloppy joe mixture. If the liquid reduces before the meat is completely tender, add an extra ½ cup stock and continue cooking. Discard bay leaf. Taste sauce and adjust seasoning with salt; keep warm.
6. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water. If using fresh pasta, cook about 3 minutes. If using dry, cook until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions.
7. Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with sauce. Add 1 cup pasta cooking liquid and ½ cup Parmesan. Increase heat to medium, bring to a simmer, and cook, tossing constantly, until pasta is al dente and liquid is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
8. Transfer pasta to a platter and top with more Parmesan.

Do Ahead: Sauce can be made 4 days ahead. Cover and chill.


#### NYT Preparation
1. Put the oil, butter and chopped onion in the pot and turn the heat on to medium. Cook and stir the onion until it has become translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring vegetables to coat them well.
2. Add ground beef, a large pinch of salt and a few grindings of pepper. Crumble the meat with a fork, stir well and cook until the beef has lost its raw, red color.
3. Add milk and let it simmer gently, stirring frequently, until it has bubbled away completely. Add a tiny grating -- about 1/8 teaspoon -- of nutmeg, and stir.
4. Add the wine, let it simmer until it has evaporated, then add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly to coat all ingredients well. When the tomatoes begin to bubble, turn the heat down so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers, with just an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface. Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more, stirring from time to time. While the sauce is cooking, you are likely to find that it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the meat. To keep it from sticking, add 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary. At the end, however, no water at all must be left and the fat must separate from the sauce. Taste and correct for salt.
5. Toss with cooked drained pasta, adding the tablespoon of butter, and serve with freshly grated Parmesan on the side.
