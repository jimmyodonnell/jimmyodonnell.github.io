#### Notes
- Kerry: I don't put as much sugar as they say and I add pumpkin seeds and chopped almonds.

### Slashfood.com's Granola:

| --- | --- |
| 2 cups | rolled oats (not instant) |
| 1 cup | peanuts or toasted almonds |
| 1/4 cup | sesame seeds |
| 1/2 cup | toasted sunflower seeds |
| 1/2 cup | unsweetened coconut |
| 1/4 cup | toasted wheat germ, flaxseed, or similar |
| 1/2 cup | raisins |
| 1/2 cup | dried fruit |
| scant 1/4 cup | cooking oil (not olive) |
| 1/2 cup | honey |

- Mix the oat, nuts and grains in a large bowl.
- Measure oil into the measuring cup and swirl it around before pouring into bowl.
- Then measure out the honey in the same, unwashed cup. The oil will help the honey exit the cup.
- Toss everything together until evenly coated and then pour out into a baking pan. I use a large roasting pan, as it keeps everything contained. A cookie sheet with a lip also works, but you have to stir it slightly more carefully if you use that.
- Bake at 300 degrees for 30 minutes, turning it with a spatula every ten minutes or so. You want everything to be an even golden brown.
- When it is finished cooking, returned the baked granola to the mixing bowl, add the raisins and fruit and stir to combine.
- Stir gently several times as it cooks, so that it doesn't clump together too much. Enjoy!

### Clumpy Granola

| --- | --- |
| 1 lb. (450g) | quick oats* |
| 3 cups (750ml/about 300g) | coarsely chopped raw nuts and/or seeds (I usually use a mixture of almonds, hazelnuts and pumpkin seeds, but use whatever tickles your fancy) |
| 1 teaspoon | ground cinnamon |
| 1/2 teaspoon | ground cardamom |
| 1/2 teaspoon | ground mace |
| 1 cup, packed (200g) | dark brown sugar |
| 1/2 cup (115g/1 stick) | unsalted butter |
| 1/3 cup (80ml) | water |
| 1/2 teaspoon | fine salt |
| 2 teaspoons | vanilla extract |
| to taste | dried fruit |

- Preheat the oven to 300F/150C.
- In a food processor, coffee grinder or blender, grind half the oats to a fine powder.
- In a large bowl, combine the whole oats, ground oats, nuts, seeds and spices.
- In a microwave-safe bowl (or in a saucepan over medium heat), combine the brown sugar, butter and water and heat just until the butter has melted and the mixture is bubbly.
- Stir the mixture together until smooth, then stir in the salt and vanilla.
- Pour this mixture over the oats and nuts, stirring well to coat (I usually do this with my hands). It should be uniformly moist - stir in another tablespoon or two of water if it isn't. Let stand for about ten minutes.
- Spread the mixture out on a large baking sheet, separating it into irregular clumps with your fingers, and allowing space between the clumps for the hot air to circulate.
- Slide into the middle of the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
- Remove from the oven and stir, gently breaking up the mixture into small-to-medium sized clumps.
- Return to the oven and bake another 15 minutes or so before stirring again.
- Repeat the bake-and-stir until the mixture is a uniform golden brown and completely dry; this usually takes 1-1 1/2 hours.
- Cool completely, then stir in any dried fruit you want to use.
- Store in a covered container at room temperature. Serve with milk or plain yogurt and fresh fruit as desired.
