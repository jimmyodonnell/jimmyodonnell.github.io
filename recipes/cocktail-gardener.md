| ---------- | ------ |
| 2 oz | mezcal or gin |
| 1 oz | lime juice |
| 1 oz | spicy ginger-cilantro syrup |

- Add ingredients to a shaker filled with ice.
- Shake and strain into a coupe or martini glass. Great on the rocks or up.

- **Mix**: Shake
- **Glass**: Cocktail, coupe, whatever
- **Over Ice**: Yes/No
- **Garnish**: serrano/jalapeno slice, lime, cilantro sprig, or none


### Spicy Ginger-Cilantro Syrup

| ---------- | ------ |
| 60 g | cilantro, preferably mostly leaves rather than stems |
| 25 g | fresh ginger root |
| 12 g | serrano pepper |
| 444 g | water |
| 414 g | sugar |

- Blend everything except the sugar in a blender.
- Let sit for at least 1 hour.
- Weigh sugar into container that will fit entire mixture (e.g. large liquid measuring cup).
- Strain blended puree into container, stir to dissolve sugar.
- Pour into bottle or jar. It will not freeze solid, so making it into ice cubes doesn't work well. Try freezing in smallish quantities (i.e. in a jar to make batches of 2 or 4 cocktails).

#### Simple syrup math:
- 15 ml sugar (14g) dissolved into 15 ml (15g) water comes to 24ml.
- final volume is 0.8 of additive volume
- "25 ounces" if volume is 710ml
- sugar ratio to final: VOLUME: 15ml of 24ml is 0.625. WEIGHT: 14g of 29g is 0.48
- Sugar: 710ml*14g/24ml = 414g
- Water: 710ml*15g/24ml = 444g

#### Notes
- 2022-06-11:
    - original recipes calls for "25 ounces simple syrup, half sugar, half water". I’m not sure whether “half sugar, half water” is by weight or volume
    - used cilantro STEMS too (the leaves alone only came to ~30g).
    - a biggish serrano after removing seeds and membranes was 13g
    - I used 360g sugar and 360g water
    - I added all of the sugar to the solids, and as much water fit
    - Don’t do this next time – only add the water to the solids and blend. Adding the sugar now just makes things harder to strain, etc.
    - I only let the solids sit in the liquid for no more than an hour. I think it was better last time, when I let it sit longer.
    - Last time, this stuff froze solid in the freezer. Now that I poured it into ice cube trays, its still gooey sweat_smile . C’est la vie.
    - Overall, flavor seems milder. Not as spicy, cilantro-ey, or gingery as the first time I made it about a month ago
