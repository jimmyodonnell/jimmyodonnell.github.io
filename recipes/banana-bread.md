#### Notes
- 2018-05-27: (Made as above?)
    - too sweet--reduce sugar from 120 g to 100 g (1/2 cup)
    - very moist, try reducing coconut milk from 1 cup to 0.75 cup
- 2019-07-04:
    - reduced sugar to 60 g
    - coconut milk to 0.5 cup
    - only had 50g coconut
    - baked in loaf pan
- 2019-10-03:
    - no sugar -- sprinkled a few tablespoons on top
    - 100g dates. should have put them in the mixer first to mash them up
    - grated meat of one fresh coconut, unpressed = 220g
    - no coconut milk
    - baked in shiny 9 square pan at 350 for XX minutes



### Banana Bread with Chocolate and Crystallized Ginger
(This is just the America's Test Kitchen recipe but ginger and chocolate)

| --- | --- |
| 6 tablespoons | unsalted butter |
| 2 cups | all-purpose flour |
| 3/4 cup | sugar |
| 3/4 teaspoon | baking soda |
| 1/2 teaspoon | salt |
| 3/4 cup | semisweet chocolate chips (or a chopped up bar) |
| 1/3 cup | finely chopped crystallized ginger |
| 2 | large eggs |
| 3 | ripe bananas, mashed |
| 1/4 cup | well-stirred whole-milk plain yogurt (not low or nonfat) |
| 1 teaspoon | vanilla extract |

1. Set a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350F. Grease a 9 by 5 loaf pan with cooking spray or butter.

2. In a small bowl, microwave the butter until just melted. (Be careful and do this over medium power in short burst because it can explode or splatter and that is a big mess.) Or melt it in the preheating oven. Set aside to cool slightly.

3. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Add the chocolate chips and crystallized ginger and whisk well to combine. Set aside.

4. In a medium bowl, lightly beat the eggs with a fork. Add the mashed banana, yogurt, melted butter, and vanilla and stir to mix well. Pour the banana mixture into the dry ingredients, and stir gently with a rubber spatula, scraping down the sides as needed, until just combined. Do not overmix. The batter with be thick and somewhat lumpy, just make sure all the flour has been incorporated. Scrape the batter into the loaf pan and smooth the top.

5. Bake into the loaf is a deep shade of golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 mins to an hour. If the loaf seems to be browning too quickly, tent with foil.

6. Cool the loaf in the pan on a wire rack for 5 mins. Then tip out onto the rack, and let it cool completely before slicing (if you can wait that long).

7. The loaf freezes well wrapped in plastic wrap and again in foil to protect from freezer burn. Try it cold, sliced fresh out of the freezer with a glass of milk or a cup of tea. Divine.
