### Ingredients

| ---------- | ------ |
| 1 cup (~200g) | white rice |
| 1.75 cup | water |
| 0.5 tsp | salt |


### Steps
- Bring all to a boil over high heat. Let boil with lid off until water cooks off until the level of the rice and water are equal.
- Put on the lid, drop heat to low, and let simmer for 20 minutes (level 2 on our back right burner).
- Turn off heat, keep lid on, and let sit another 5 minutes undisturbed.
- Take off lid, fluff, and serve or replace lid.
- _Note_: 1 cup of white rice is approximately 200 grams. Rinsing and draining adds about 20g of water.


#### Brown Rice

For brown rice, increase water from 1.75 to 2 cups. put all in a saucepan, heat to a boil with lid off. Once it comes to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low. after 40 minutes, turn off burner and leave covered for at least five minutes. Uncover and fluff with a fork.
Basically like white rice except (1) a little more water, (2) don't let the water boil down before covering, and (3) longer cook time.
