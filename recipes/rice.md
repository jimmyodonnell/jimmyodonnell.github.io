### Ingredients
- rice: 1 cup
- water: 1.75 cup
- salt: 0.5 tsp
- (optional) butter: 1 tbsp

| Ingredient | Amount |
| ---------- | ------ |
| white rice   | 1 cup |
| water | 1.75 cup |
| salt | 0.5 tsp |


### Steps
Bring all to a boil, let simmer with lid off until water cooks off until the level of the rice and water are equal.

Put on the lid, drop heat to lowest setting, let simmer for 20 minutes (gas level 2 on our back right burner).

Turn off heat, keep lid on, and let sit another 5 minutes undisturbed.

take off lid, fluff, serve or replace lid.

#### Brown Rice

For brown rice, increase water from 1.75 to 2 cups. put all in a saucepan, heat to a boil with lid off. Once it comes to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low. after 40 minutes, turn off burner and leave covered for at least five minutes. Uncover and fluff with a fork.
Basically like white rice except (1) a little more water, (2) don't let the water boil down before covering, and (3) longer cook time.
