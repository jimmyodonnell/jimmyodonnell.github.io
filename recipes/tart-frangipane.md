### Tart Filling

| ---------- | ------ |
| ½ cup (125g) | unsalted butter, at room temperature |
| 1/2 cup (100g) | sugar |
| 1 tsp | vanilla extract |
| 1 tsp | almond extract |
| 2 | large eggs |
| 1 ¼ cups | ground almond (120g) |
| 3 tablespoons (45g) | unbleached all-purpose flour |

- In a large mixing bowl, whisk the butter until creamy. Add the sugar and continue whisking until fluffy.
- Add the eggs, one by one, beating well after each addition.
- Whisk in the vanilla and almond extract.
- Finally, whisk in the ground almond and the flour. Mix until just incorporated.

### Baking the tart
- Pour into a prepared (perhaps blind baked?!) [tart crust](recipes/tart-crust.md)
- Top with halved stone fruit, cut side down. Perhaps also sliced almonds?
- Bake for 40+ minutes at 350ºF
- Let cool, serve topped with whipped cream or powdered sugar.

#### Source
Mostly based off of [Pardon Your French](https://www.pardonyourfrench.com/apricot-frangipane-tart/)

#### Notes
- Consider other nuts... pecans, pistachios, walnuts, etc
- Note that Pardon Your French does not blind bake the crust -- to consider next time!
