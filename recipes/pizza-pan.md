| ---------- | ------ |
| 2.25 tsp | active dry yeast |
| 1.75 cup (400 g) | warm water |
| 2 TBSP | olive oil |
| 2 tsp | kosher salt |
| 4 cups (480 g) | all purpose flour |


1. Stir together yeast and 1¾ cups warm water (105–110°) in the bowl of a stand mixer; let stand until yeast starts to foam, about 10 minutes.

2. Mix in 2 Tbsp. oil, then salt and 2 cups flour. Attach dough hook and mix until just combined. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add another 2 cups flour, a cup at a time, mixing until incorporated and a shaggy dough forms, about 3 minutes.

3. Increase speed to medium and mix until dough is soft and elastic and starts to pull away from sides of bowl, 5–6 minutes. It will still be somewhat sticky. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Chill 24 hours.

4. Coat an 18x13" rimmed baking sheet with remaining ½ cup oil. Turn out dough onto a rimmed baking sheet and let sit 10 minutes to take off the chill. Gently and gradually stretch dough until it reaches edges and all 4 corners of baking sheet. (If dough springs back or is stiff to work with, let it rest a few minutes before continuing. You may need to let it rest more than once.)

5. Cover dough on baking sheet tightly with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place (but not too warm!—about 70° is ideal for yeast to grow) until it is puffed and full of air bubbles, 30–40 minutes.

6. Once dough is ready, preheat oven to 500ºF while you add toppings. For this style of pizza I like to do cheese first, top it with sauce, then other stuff. You will probably need about 16 oz of sauce and 8 to 16 oz of cheese.

7. Bake at 500ºF for about 30-40 minutes.

#### Notes:
- A darker pan is best, as it makes for a darker crust.
