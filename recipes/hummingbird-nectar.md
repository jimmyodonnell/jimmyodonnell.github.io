| ---------- | ------ |
| 1/4 cup (50g) | sugar |
| 1 cup (225g) | water |

- Measure all water into a container.
- Measure sugar into a glass measuring cup large enough to hold full volume.
- Add a small part of the water to the sugar and microwave.
- Once dissolved, add rest of the water. This cools it and brings it to the correct final volume.
