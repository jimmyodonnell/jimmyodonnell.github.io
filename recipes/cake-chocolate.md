### Chocolate Cake

| ---------- | ------ |
| 3 ounces (85g) | fine-quality semisweet chocolate such as Callebaut |
| 1 1/2 cups (355mL) | hot brewed coffee |
| 3 cups (600g) | sugar |
| 2 1/2 cups (315g)| all-purpose flour |
| 1 1/2 cups (~130g) | unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch process)  |
| 2 teaspoons (10g) | baking soda |
| 3/4 teaspoon (4g) | baking powder |
| 1 1/4 teaspoons (7g) | salt |
| 3 | large eggs |
| 3/4 cup (175mL) | vegetable oil |
| 1 1/2 cups (355mL | well-shaken buttermilk |
| 3/4 teaspoon | vanilla |
| two  | 10 inch round cake pans (157 square inches) |

- Make cake layers:

- Preheat oven to 300Â°F and grease pans. Line bottoms with rounds of wax paper and grease paper.

- Finely chop chocolate and in a bowl combine with hot coffee. Let mixture stand, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.

- Into a large bowl sift together sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.

- In another large bowl with an electric mixer beat eggs until thickened slightly and lemon colored (about 3 minutes with a standing mixer or 5 minutes with a hand-held mixer).
- Slowly add oil, buttermilk, vanilla, and melted chocolate mixture to eggs, beating until combined well.
- Add sugar mixture and beat on medium speed until just combined well.
- Divide batter between pans and bake in middle of oven until a tester inserted in center comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes.
- Cool layers completely in pans on racks. Run a thin knife around edges of pans and invert layers onto racks.
- Carefully remove wax paper and cool layers completely. Cake layers may be made 1 day ahead and kept, wrapped well in plastic wrap, at room temperature.

Spread frosting between cake layers and over top and sides. Cake keeps, covered and chilled, 3 days. Bring cake to room temperature before serving.
