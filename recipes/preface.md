This is a collection of recipes we make on a regular basis.

### Why?
My favorite format for following a recipe in the kitchen is the good old-fashioned hard (paper) copy. Obviously there is a lot of useful stuff on the 'net, but scrolling back and forth on a small screen that regularly turns off is a pain. However, most websites format their recipes with these characteristics:
- A pop up asking you to sign up for their newsletter
- A wall of text describing the pattern of the tablecloth at the author's friends' grandmas house where they first ate this dish
- A full-HD video streaming one video after another, complete with ads, that condenses to a "handy" mini-player.

### Some notes
not sure how to categorize: are crepes a breakfast food? I have a "mexican" category -- why not one for "french"?

don't want to weigh in to political boundaries and culinary history -- vietnamese and thai = se asia, stuff with lots of curry powder flavor == s asia, stir fries with lots of sesame oil flavor == e asia.
