not sure how to categorize: are crepes a breakfast food? I have a "mexican" category -- why not one for "french"?

don't want to weigh in to political boundaries and culinary history -- vietnamese and thai = se asia, stuff with lots of curry powder flavor == s asia, stir fries with lots of sesame oil flavor == e asia.
