Original recipe calls for a squash that weighs about 3 lbs. Here are the amounts per pound of squash.

| ---------- | ------ |
| 1 tbsp | butter |
| 1 lb | butternut squash |
| 1 | small shallot |
| 2 cups | water or broth |
| to taste | salt |
| 1/6 cup | heavy cream |
| 1/3 tsp | dark brown sugar |
| pinch | freshly grated nutmeg |


1. Prep the squash by cutting into big chunks (e.g. 4-8 chunks), reserving the seeds and membrane.
2. In a big pot, cook the shallot in butter until transluscent, then add the seeds and membrane from the squash and cook until butter takes on the color of the squash.
3. Add the water or broth to the cooked solids, put a steamer basket on top, and then put squash in and steam until tender, about 30 minutes.
4. Transfer squash to a baking sheet to let cool.
5. Strain the liquid into a big bowl. It should have reduced in volume by half, so that you have 1 cup per pound of squash. Wipe or rinse out the pot.
6. Pur√©e the squash and liquid either in batches in a blender, or using an immersion blender.
7. Return to the pot, stir in any remaining steaming liquid, the cream, brown sugar, salt, and nutmet to taste. Warm over medium-low heat.
